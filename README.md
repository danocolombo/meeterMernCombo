# meeterMERN-server
***
## BETA RELEASE 1.1
This was the initial release published for beta testing with Village church on Heroku.


## Origin and Background
This project started out as a modernization effort of the PHP web appliation known as "meeter".  Meeter was and is a client specific php web application integrated with a Mysql database.  

This design began with a couple different MERN (Mongo, Express, React and Node) classes.

There was an attempt to abstact the backend from the front end, but at this time the plan is to get the clients moved over to no-SQL databases and maybe move back to mysql for performance and cost (hosted by Rogue Intel) with no restrictions of size, or instances.

## Current definition
There is one Node application, currently defined as meeterMernCombo, which means front and backend combined (combo).  This was the merging of two repos we had established, meeterMERN-client and meeterMERN-server.  Those two repos have since been archived and this will be the code base moving forward.
